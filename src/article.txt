San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard followed up his first Defensive Player of the Year Award with his first appearance on the NBA's All-Defensive First Team.

Leonard was joined by Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, Memphis Grizzlies guard Tony Allen, Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul and his teammate, center DeAndre Jordan.

All five players come from Western Conference playoff teams, with all but two of the 10 players selected to the first and second teams coming from the West.

The second team consisted of forwards Anthony Davis (New Orleans Pelicans) and Tim Duncan (Spurs), guards Jimmy Butler (Chicago Bulls) and John Wall (Washington Wizards), and center Andrew Bogut (Warriors).

The Clippers, Spurs and Warriors each put two players on the NBA's All-Defensive teams.

Earning second-team honors on the All-Defensive squad earned Bogut a bonus of $1.9 million, league sources told ESPN.com's Marc Stein. The precise bonus in Bogut's contract, according to sources, is valued at $1,945,946 and‎ was triggered by playing in at least 65 games with any one of the following honors: All-Star selection; first-, second- or third-team All-NBA; ‎first or second team All-Defense; or NBA Defensive Player of the Year.

A panel of 129 American and Canadian sportswriters and broadcasters voted on the All-Defensive teams, with two points being awarded for each first-team vote and one point being awarded for the second-team vote. Voters had to select two guards, two forwards and a center.
